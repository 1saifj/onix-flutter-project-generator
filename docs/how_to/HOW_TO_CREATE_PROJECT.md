Enter the **name and organization** of your application.

Android package name: com.onix.demo
Bundle ID: com.onix.demo
```

To import you need:

You can get it from the Figma url. Usually Figma file looks like: 

```
https://www.figma.com/design/{file_id}/
```

Copy `{file_id}` and paste into the Figma file Key input.

* **Figma token**.

To get a Figma token open the menu in Figma and go to **Account Settings**. Scroll down until you see the **Personal access tokens** section. Press the **Generate Token** button to Create a new token. 

After the token has created paste it in to Figma token input.
