We're always looking for ways to make Onix Project Generator better, so please **share how you use our application, what features you think we should add** via [GitHub](https://github.com/Onix-Systems/onix-flutter-project-generator/issues/new?assignees=&labels=enhancement&projects=&template=feature_request.md&title=).

## Setup you environment

To start contribution you need following setup:

* [Flutter SDK](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) version **v3.19.6**.

When your environment is ready you can [fork the repository](https://github.com/Onix-Systems/onix-flutter-project-generator/fork).

## Cloning the repository

After you fork the Project Generator repository, you need to clone it to your local machine.

Instead of using the `Onix-Systems/onix-flutter-project-generator` repository, you should use your fork url. This way, you can push your changes to your fork and create a pull request from there.


```
git clone https://github.com/Onix-Systems/onix-flutter-project-generator.git
```

## Installing dependencies

After you clone repository you need to install the dependencies. 

Open `pubspec.yaml` file and press **Pub get** button or run following command:

```
flutter pub get
```

## Run the application

<span style="color:red">**Before you run the application you need to change `repoUrl` in `lib/core/app/app_consts.dart`
to your repository URL. If you do not do so the application will use our repository to get remote configurations (like Mason Brick)**</span>.

After you installed the dependencies and everything looks good you can run the project using **Run button** in your IDE or using the command:

```
flutter run
``` 

<span style="color:red">**If you have made changes in Mason brick make sure you pushed your changes to repository and selected actual branch in application's branch menu (to use Mason brick from that branch)**</span>.

## Application's work flow 

**To have a better understanding of what processes take place** in the project and how the project works in general, [we have prepared documentation](flows/FLOWS.md) that **describes the basic processes of the application and the flow of commands**.
